When you enter a website address into your browser, the browser sends a request to a DNS server, which looks up the IP address associated with that domain name and returns it to the browser. The browser can then use that IP address to connect to the website\'s server and retrieve the website\'s content.","sidebar":"devopsSidebar"},"devops/git":{"id":"devops/git","title":"Git","description":"Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system that is widely used in software development.
