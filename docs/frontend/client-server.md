# Client Server Architecture

Client-server architecture is a model for building distributed systems, where software applications are divided into two separate parts - client-side and server-side. The client-side runs on the user's device, such as a computer or mobile device, and is responsible for the user interface and user interactions. The server-side runs on a remote server, and is responsible for handling data storage, processing, and managing communication with other servers or services.

In a client-server architecture, the client-side and server-side communicate with each other over a network, typically the internet, using protocols such as HTTP, TCP/IP, and FTP. The client sends requests to the server for data or services, and the server responds with the requested information or performs the requested services. The client then processes and displays the information for the user.

One of the main advantages of client-server architecture is the separation of concerns between client-side and server-side. This allows for easier development, maintenance, and scaling of applications, as changes to one side do not necessarily require changes to the other. Additionally, the server-side can handle heavy data processing and storage tasks, allowing for a better user experience on the client-side.

Examples of applications that use client-server architecture include web browsers, email clients, online shopping websites, and online gaming platforms.
