# Front End

The Front End Development section of this book is dedicated to the building blocks of web development that are visible to the user. This includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and popular libraries such as React and Next.js. In this section, we will explore the fundamentals of front end development and how to create beautiful and functional websites.

HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the foundation of every website. It provides the structure and content of a web page, defining headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is used to style the HTML elements, defining colors, fonts, layout, and other visual elements. JavaScript is a programming language used to add interactivity and dynamic features to a website, such as animations, pop-ups, and form validation.

React is a popular JavaScript library used for building complex user interfaces. It provides a component-based architecture that allows developers to build reusable and modular UI components. Next.js is a framework built on top of React, providing a set of tools and features to make building React applications easier and faster.

In this section, we will cover the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as how to use React and Next.js to build modern and responsive web applications. We will also explore best practices for front end development, such as accessibility, performance optimization, and responsive design.

By the end of this section, you will have a solid understanding of front end development and the tools and techniques needed to create beautiful and functional web applications.
