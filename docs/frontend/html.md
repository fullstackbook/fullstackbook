# HTML

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language used for creating and structuring content on the web. It allows developers to describe the structure and semantics of a web page, including text, images, links, and other media.

HTML documents are made up of elements, each of which has a start tag, content, and an end tag. For example, the `<p>` element is used to indicate a paragraph of text and has a start tag `<p>` and an end tag `</p>`. Attributes can be added to elements to provide additional information about them, such as the src attribute on an `<img>` tag, which specifies the URL of the image to be displayed.

The latest version of HTML is HTML5, which includes many new features such as support for multimedia, better accessibility, and new semantic elements that make it easier for search engines and screen readers to understand the content of a page.

HTML is the foundation of the web and is an essential tool for any web developer. It can be combined with other web technologies such as CSS and JavaScript to create dynamic and engaging web pages.
