# Introduction

Full Stack Book is a quick reference guide to help developers quickly learn and become productive in modern web frameworks.

It accomplishes this through project based examples. A project is a set of requirements which consists of the Project Description, an API Contract, and a UI Mockup.

The API Contract is implemented by any Back End framework and consumed by any Front End framework.

The UI Mockup is implemented by the Front End framework.

By conforming to an API Contract and UI Mockup, the Back Ends and Front Ends are completely interchangeable. Essentially, a Project can be implemented using any combination of Back End and Front End web framework.

The examples are implemented using common architectural patterns found in the real world. By studying the examples, any intermediate developer should be able to quickly ramp up to any tech stack.

Full Stack Book is not a replacement for reading documentation or step by step tutorials. Instead, it should be used like a cheat sheet or a quick reference. It will probably work best for those who already know the basics of web development.

Full Stack Book may also be used by engineers looking to compare various tech stacks to aid in picking a framework for their own project. A GitHub repo is provided for each implementation.
