# Full Stack List

By Travis Luong, Author of Full Stack Book

Full Stack List is a curated list for Full Stack Developers.

In this list, I reveal all of the tools and resources that I personally use as a Full Stack Developer.

The recommendations are based on how much I have actually used the tools in recent years, as well as my perceived value of the tool.

This list contains over 100 tools that I have used in over a decade of working as a Full Stack Developer.

I also provide commentary and tips on how I use each tool.

While there have been many other tools that I have used in the past, the ones in this list are the ones that I am actively using today.

By purchasing this list, you will be actively supporting the channel and the book!

You will also be invited to join a private Discord server where you can discuss Full Stack Development with other like-minded Full Stack Developers.
