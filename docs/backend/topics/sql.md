# SQL

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a programming language that is used for managing and manipulating data in relational databases. It provides a standard way of interacting with databases, enabling users to create, read, update, and delete records.

SQL is a powerful tool for managing large amounts of data. It allows users to retrieve data from one or more tables based on a set of criteria. SQL can also be used to manipulate data by inserting, updating, or deleting records. Additionally, it can be used to create and modify database structures, such as tables, columns, and indexes.

Some common SQL commands include:

SELECT: used to retrieve data from one or more tables
INSERT: used to insert new records into a table
UPDATE: used to modify existing records in a table
DELETE: used to delete records from a table
CREATE: used to create new database objects, such as tables, indexes, and views
ALTER: used to modify existing database objects
DROP: used to delete database objects
SQL is used in a wide range of applications, from small websites to large enterprise systems. It is supported by many popular database management systems, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.

While SQL is a powerful tool for working with relational databases, it does have some limitations. For example, it can be difficult to work with non-relational data, such as unstructured data or data that does not fit into a table-based format. Additionally, SQL can be less efficient than other database management systems for certain types of queries.

Despite these limitations, SQL remains an essential tool for managing and manipulating data in relational databases, and is widely used in the industry.
