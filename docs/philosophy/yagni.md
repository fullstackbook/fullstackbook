# YAGNI

YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It) is a software development principle that suggests that a programmer should not add functionality unless it is necessary to meet the current requirements. The principle was coined by Kent Beck in his book "Extreme Programming Explained" and is often associated with agile development methodologies.

The basic idea behind YAGNI is that adding features that are not needed can result in unnecessary complexity and bloat in the codebase, which can lead to maintenance problems and increased development costs. By only implementing the features that are actually needed, developers can focus on delivering value and avoid wasting time on unnecessary work.

The YAGNI principle is closely related to the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle, which suggests that developers should strive for simplicity in their code and avoid unnecessary complexity. Both principles aim to encourage developers to focus on delivering value and avoid getting bogged down in unnecessary work.

Overall, YAGNI is a useful principle for developers to keep in mind when working on software projects. By focusing on the features that are actually needed and avoiding unnecessary complexity, developers can deliver high-quality software that meets the needs of their users while minimizing development costs and maintenance headaches.
