# SSL

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is a protocol used for securing communications over the internet. SSL is used to encrypt data transferred between a client and a server, ensuring that sensitive information cannot be intercepted and read by an unauthorized party.

SSL works by establishing a secure connection between a client and a server. The process begins with a client sending a request to a server. The server responds by sending a certificate, which contains its public key. The client then verifies the certificate and generates a random key, which is encrypted using the server's public key and sent back to the server. The server decrypts the key using its private key, and the client and server then use this key to encrypt and decrypt all subsequent communications.

SSL is commonly used for securing web-based communications, such as e-commerce transactions, online banking, and login pages. It is also used in other applications that require secure communication, such as email and messaging systems.

SSL has been superseded by the newer TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocol, but the terms SSL and TLS are often used interchangeably. The most recent version of TLS is TLS 1.3, which was released in 2018 and includes improvements to security and performance.

In summary, SSL is a protocol that provides encryption and security for communications over the internet, ensuring that sensitive information cannot be intercepted and read by unauthorized parties. It is commonly used for securing web-based communications and has been superseded by the newer TLS protocol.
